> Man Pages for Global Node Modules, right in the terminal.

## Installation

```
npm install -g man-made
```

## How Does it Work?

This tools finds the list of global modules, and converts the package's readme into manual page documentations and stores them a directory called `.man-made` in the user's üè° HOME directory.

It also updates your shell configuration's MANPATH to use these newly added manual pages.

This works with most shells, including

- zsh
- bash
- fish
- csh
- ksh
